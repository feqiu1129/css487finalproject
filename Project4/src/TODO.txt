Todo lists

Clark:
	Look at different data sets - see also Fisher et al preprint
	Reading about previous work
		Also Tombone's blog looks pretty interesting
	Maybe:
		Implement/test hue histogram with one spatial bin and additional hue bins - van de Weijer uses 37 
	

Siqi:
	Implement classification using bag-of-words

Sam:
	Set up testing on ALOI data set (illumination)

		
Longer term:
	Compare against deepdesc: github.com/etruls/deepdesc-release
	Need more data sets - explore ImageNet http://www.image-net.org/
	More descriptor variations? Prioritize these:
		Meta: DSP-SIFT!
		Color: rgb (2d hist), color angles (see van de Weijer), hueSIFT?, moment invariants, OpponentHist?
		Texture: Small images (color/grey), RIFT
		Shape: GLOH, Shape contexts, Ferrari paper on Contour Segment Networks
	Try using descriptors independently and combining later (rather than stacking)
	Implement classification using new descriptors
	Other interesting ways to combine descriptors (subspace clustering? machine learning?)
